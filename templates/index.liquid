  <div class="large4 small4 col">
    <p>1 <strong>Generate many ideas</strong>. Post ideas in the kitchen whiteboard, anything that you consider interesting. Remeber, just because you posted something doesn't mean you're responsible for developing it! Others may kidnap and expand your idea.</p>
    <p>Add a little detail about it, using the business model canvas generator: the audience, actors, benefits for Webcredible, etc.</p>
    <p>Deadline: X January 2015</p>
  </div>
  <div class="large4 small4 col">
    <p>2 <strong>Present ideas to the panel</strong>.<br>Think about it as an elevator pitch. 1-2 minutes each idea, to explain why is good, how is going to make Webcredible famous, and how do you think we can design/build it.</p>

  <div class="large4 small4 col">
    <p>3 <strong>Pitch to the Dragon's Den</strong>. Each idea will have 20-30 minutes to present </p>
